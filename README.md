Wavelet Transform with pywt (Python)

I did not find a detailed tutorial about wavelet transform with pywt (a package in Python) online. So, I tried to write my own in form of a jupyter notebook. The tutorial is fairly basic and detailed so that a non-expert with basic knowledge in Python and Fourier-Transform can understand it. Some questions and uncertainties remained, hence I formulated some questions within the notebook. Feedback and corrections are most welcome!
