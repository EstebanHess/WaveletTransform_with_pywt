Wavelet Transform with pywt (Python)

I did not find a detailed tutorial about wavelet transform with pywt (a package in Python) online. So, I tried to write my own in form of a jupyter notebook. The tutorial is fairly basic and detailed so that a non-expert with basic knowledge in Python and Fourier-Transform can understand it. 

The notebook WaveletTryout.ipynb explores the functionalities of pywt in general.
The notebook Extract_High_Freqs.ipynb is dedicated to the task of extracting the higher frequencies from a signal. 

In general, feedback and corrections are most welcome!
